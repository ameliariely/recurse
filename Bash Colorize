- Can you change out color with any func other than echo?
- Does a var get stored somewhere when you echo a control sequence?
- Does echo -e still exist? I don't seem to need it. Also man echo only shows the -n arg.
	- There is an external and "builtin" to the shell version of echo. 
- How does zsh run bash scripts?
	- if you put a shebang line declaring bash, zsh knows to run it with bash
	- nearly all syntax from bash scripts works in zsh
- Why am I using zsh? 
	- It is now what comes pre-installed and updated on macOS. It's also supposedly has some advantages over sh and bash?
	- seems like echo acts the same in zsh and bash
